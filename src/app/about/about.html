        With over six years in the industry, I've had the privilege of working
        on a diverse range of projects, from telecommunications and e-commerce
        platforms to transportation management systems. My passion lies in
        turning complex problems into elegant, scalable software solutions.

        My expertise is in full-stack development using
        <span class="text-accent">Angular</span> and
        <span class="text-accent">Python/Django</span>. I have a strong command
        of modern Angular features like Standalone Components and Signals, and I
        leverage NgRx for robust state management. I'm also experienced in
        building cross-platform mobile apps with
        <span class="text-accent">React Native</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy architecting systems from the ground up, particularly using
        <span class="text-accent">microfrontends</span> with Nx and
        <span class="text-accent">microservices</span> with Docker and AWS. This
        approach allows for modular, scalable, and independently deployable
        systems. I'm dedicated to writing clean, high-quality code and ensuring
        applications are accessible to all users by following WCAG standards.
